I will be able to demonstrate the necessary skills to create a simple HTML website.
This will include topics from Elements and Tags, HTML boilerplate, Working with Text,
Lists, Links and Images, Commit Messages.

The resulted website should showcase all that I have learned from the HTML Foundations.
